// @ts-check
// A COPY, ON PURPOSE: this is `a11ign/screenreader-fleet`'s `src/cli-flags.ts` (published as `@a11ign/screenreader-fleet/cli-flags`), kept here
// because the root scripts that run BEFORE `node_modules` exists (`preinstall`, `prepare`, the tool-only CI jobs) cannot import a package. They
// used to reach it by a relative path into `packages/worker-fleet/`, which left the workspace with #3504. It imports `node:` built-ins only. The ONE edit to the text: a comment spelled out
// the entry-guard comparison, which `generate-commands-doc.ts` reads as "this file is a command" and asks for a `// command:` header.
/**
 * Refuse a flag this command does not read.
 *
 * Every CLI here parses argv the same way — `process.argv.find((a) => a.startsWith("--only="))` or
 * `process.argv.includes("--resume")` — and every one of them therefore IGNORES anything it does not
 * recognise. A mistyped, renamed or hallucinated flag runs the default and reports success, and the
 * operator believes their value was applied. That is the same defect as an Ansible extra var a job does
 * not read, one layer out, and this repo has paid for it twice:
 *
 *   - a blocker's own message told the reader to run `--write-baseline`; the flag is `--update-baseline`
 *   - `--only=route-title-stale` covered 1 of the 7 cases in that family, because the match was exact-id
 *
 * Neither produced an error. Both produced a plausible wrong answer, which this file's governing rule
 * says to replace with a refusal that names the cause.
 *
 * ## Why the known list is passed in rather than read from the caller's source
 *
 * Deriving it at runtime — reading the calling module and regexing out its `--flags` — needs no
 * maintenance, and is wrong for one reason that matters: a CLI whose flags are consumed by a HELPER in
 * another module would refuse them, so the guard would break exactly the commands with the most moving
 * parts. The list is explicit here and `cli-flags.test.ts` derives the same set from source and pins the
 * two equal, which is this repo's remedy when a duplication is forced.

 * a worker address, a page path — and is not this guard's business.
 *
 * SINGLE-DASH FLAGS ARE INSPECTED TOO, AND THE OMISSION COST A 14-MINUTE FLEET OPERATION.
 *
 * This read `startsWith("--")`, on the reasoning that only long flags are ever this repo's own. But an
 * ANSIBLE-shaped argument is single-dash, and several of these commands wrap `ansible-playbook` — so
 * `npm run fleet:provision -- -e worker_edge_allow_downgrade=true` passed straight through the guard,
 * was never forwarded by the wrapper, and the whole fleet was provisioned WITHOUT the authorisation the
 * operator believed they had given. Measured 2026-09-05. The role then refused, correctly, with a message
 * telling the operator to pass the very flag they had just passed.
 *
 * That is precisely the defect this file exists to prevent — "an ignored flag runs the default and reports
 * success" — surviving inside its own remedy, because the remedy was written to match one flag SHAPE
 * rather than the idea of a flag. `-e` is not a URL and not a page path; nothing positional here begins
 * with a dash followed by a letter, which is what makes this safe to refuse rather than merely warn on.
