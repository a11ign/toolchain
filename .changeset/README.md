# Changesets

A change that should reach npm carries a changeset: `pnpm exec changeset`, naming `@a11ign/toolchain` and the size of the change.

**Merging one to `main` is the release.** `release.yml` calls the one reusable per-merge workflow (`release-per-merge.yml`): a push whose tree carries a changeset no tag has consumed is versioned on a detached commit, published, tagged and released. There is no version pull request, and nothing is written to `main`, so its package versions and changelogs lag the last tag. `scripts/release-per-merge.ts` holds the logic and `scripts/release-per-merge.test.ts` pins it.
