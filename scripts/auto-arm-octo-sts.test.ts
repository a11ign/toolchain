// no-token: none -- reads two files of this repository and matches the policy's patterns against claim values measured on a11ign/a11ign#4191.
/**
 * a11ign/a11ign#4199: `auto-arm.yml` ARMS WITH AN OCTO STS TOKEN, AND THE POLICY BEHIND IT HOLDS ONLY WHAT ARMING NEEDS.
 *
 * Two halves, each with the control that shows it can fail (a11ign/a11ign's `auto-arm-octo-sts.test.ts` is the original, #4198):
 *   - the POLICY (`.github/chainguard/auto-arm.sts.yaml`): grants pull-request write and contents write and nothing else, and its patterns accept the
 *     claims of main's copy of this workflow and refuse the ones that are not. Octo STS matches every pattern against the WHOLE claim (v0.11.2
 *     README), which `fullMatch` reproduces.
 *   - the WORKFLOW: the job mints before it uses, holds `id-token: write` and no other write, reads no stored token, falls back to nothing, and
 *     carries no `token-reach` probe of the token it no longer reads.
